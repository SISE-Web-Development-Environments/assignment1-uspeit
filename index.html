      <h1>About Me</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
      My name is Galina Stissis, I was born in Russia in 1948 and immigrated to Israel with my Family at 1997. <br>
      I am currently spending my isolation at Ashdod, where I live alone, trying to evade the Coronavirus. <br>
      Although my 3 children and their families
      live in Ashdod as well, I haven't seen any of them in over a month because of the virus, and it hasnâ€™t been easy.
      <br>
    </p>

      I grew up in a small town in east Russia, in a family of 6. As a child I
      never used to spend time on my own, I was always surrounded by friends and family,
      which at the time seemed difficult, but now I miss dearly. <br>
      The hardest thing for me about the current state is the boredom and loneliness which is a privilege of itself,
      because I do not have any issues regarding food, medication or basic needs, which many others unfortunately do.
      <br> The loneliness, however, has been a new challenge for me and
      I struggle with it. The main thing I do to pass the time usually is playing cards with my neighbours and visiting
      my children and grandchildren, but now I cant
      do any of these things so I struggle. <br> I have taken upon myself to solving crosswords again, and it has helped
      me a little. <br>
      I know that in a few weeks or month this difficult time that were all going through will come to an end, and I
      Will go back to spending time with family
      and enjoying the outdoors.
