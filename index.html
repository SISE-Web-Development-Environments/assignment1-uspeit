      <h1>About Me</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
      My name is Galina Stissis, I was born in Russia in 1948 and immigrated to Israel with my Family at 1997. <br>
      I am currently spending my isolation at Ashdod, where I live alone, trying to evade the Coronavirus. <br>
      Although my 3 children and their families
      live in Ashdod as well, I haven't seen any of them in over a month because of the virus, and it hasnâ€™t been easy.
      <br>
    </p>

      I grew up in a small town in east Russia, in a family of 6. As a child I
      never used to spend time on my own, I was always surrounded by friends and family,
      which at the time seemed difficult, but now I miss dearly. <br>
      The hardest thing for me about the current state is the boredom and loneliness which is a privilege of itself,
      because I do not have any issues regarding food, medication or basic needs, which many others unfortunately do.
      <br> The loneliness, however, has been a new challenge for me and
      I struggle with it. The main thing I do to pass the time usually is playing cards with my neighbours and visiting
      my children and grandchildren, but now I cant
      do any of these things so I struggle. <br> I have taken upon myself to solving crosswords again, and it has helped
      me a little. <br>
      I know that in a few weeks or month this difficult time that were all going through will come to an end, and I
      Will go back to spending time with family
      and enjoying the outdoors.

      <h3> Explain 3 major differences between Web1 / Web2 / Web3</h3>
      Web 1-3 describe the stages of development of the web ecosystem.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Interaction</b> - Interaction with the content has changed greatly between the generations of the internet.
          <br>
          Web 1 - Static websites being presented to the user - a one way interaction<br>
          Web 2 - Dynamic web applications allow for more complex applications that interact with the user<br>
          Web 3 - Smart applications that are customized for the user's behaviour and needs.<br>
          <i><u>Example:</u></i> On Web1, you can visit web sites and view their content, and Web2 you can interact with
          it - change it or add to it, on Web3 the internet is embedded into everything we use, and turning on the light
          is considered an interaction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Orientation</b> - Web content orientation has changed between the generations of the internet.<br>
          Web 1 - Static websites representing <u>corporations and companies</u><br>
          Web 2 - Dynamic web applications push the net towards <u>community</u> - Comments / rating / Social networks
          etc.<br>
          Web 3 - The web becomes an <u>induviduals</u> window to the world.<br>
          <i><u>Example:</u></i> Searching for "Side effects of medication" on Web1 would probably lead to an offical
          page of the pharmaceutical company describing the side effects, on Web2 it would probably lead to Blog or
          Facebook posts, and on Web3 to a web application connected to your medical history and aware of your medical
          conditions.

        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Scope</b> - The amount of users connected to the internet has increased between generations of the
          internet.<br>
          Web 1 - Websites accessible by special equipment (computers) not accessible to all</u><br>
          Web 2 - Web is accessible almost by anyone via more widespread computers and more importantly - Personal
          smartphones<br>
          Web 3 - The web provides communication between devices and people. Data is collected, analyzed and shared.
          <br>
          <i><u>Example:</u></i> Web1 users were people who had computers and connected to the internet, Web2 users
          became more casual because everyone could connect, on Web3 everyone is connected by everything.
